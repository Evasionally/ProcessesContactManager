							<h3>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan;</h3>
							<p>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also
								 known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin,
								 Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write and co-produce the majority of their material.
								 Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres,
								 while their lyricism has focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth
								 and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and
								 recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychological
								 concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.</p>
